(c) Add inside the armando.urdf.xacro the commands to enable the Gazebo ROS2 control plugin and load the joint position controllers from a .yaml file. Then, spawn the joint state broadcaster and the position controllers using the controller_manager package from the armando_world.launch. Launch the Gazebo robot simulation and demonstrate how the hardware interface is correctly loaded and connected. Hint: use the RegisterEventHandler function to load controllers after gazebo is started
