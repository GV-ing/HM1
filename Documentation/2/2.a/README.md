(a) Create a package named armando_gazebo using ros2 CLI. Within this package, create a launch folder containing a armando_world.launch file and fill it with commands that load the URDF into the /robot_description topic and spawn your robot using the create node in the ros_gz_sim package. Hint: follow the gazebo.launch.py from the ros2_urdf tutorial package here. Launch the armando_world.launch file to start the simulation of your robot in Gazebo
