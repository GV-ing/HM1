(b) Add a PositionJointInterface as a hardware interface to your robot using the ros2_control framework. Create an armando_hardware_interface.xacro file in the armando_description/urdf folder, containing a macro that defines the hardware interface for the joints of your robot, and include it in your main armando.urdf.xacro file using xacro:include. Hint: remember to rename your URDF file to arm.urdf.xacro, add the string xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org /wiki/xacro" within the <robot> tag, and load the URDF in your launch file using the xacro routine as shown in here
